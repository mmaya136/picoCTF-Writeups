## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to locate and recover a hidden flag by inspecting and analyzing the source code of a web page whose contents have been minified.

---

## Description
The challenge provides access to a web application where the website code has been compressed to reduce file size and improve loading speed.  
Instead of scrolling through unreadable minified code in the browser, the task is to inspect the raw page source and uncover the hidden flag.

---

## Provided Data
The challenge provides a running web instance accessible through a URL.

<img width="1916" height="911" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8cf2f08-04af-45b9-9226-003b4bdf4baa" />

The page loads normally in the browser and does not visibly display the flag.  
This indicates that the flag is likely embedded directly in the page source rather than rendered on screen.

---

## Analysis

By directly fetching the page source using curl, the full HTML content is revealed without any formatting applied by the browser.
Inspecting this raw output shows that the flag is already present inside the HTML source.
By piping the output through grep picoCTF, the flag can be easily located within the minified content.
