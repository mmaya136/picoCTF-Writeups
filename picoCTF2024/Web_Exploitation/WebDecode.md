## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to locate and decode hidden information within a web application in order to recover the flag.

## Description
This challenge provides access to a simple web page and asks whether the user knows how to use the **web inspector**.  
By inspecting the files loaded by the page and analyzing their contents, hidden data can be uncovered.

The task is to explore the page resources, identify encoded content, and decode it to retrieve the flag.

## Analysis

By inspecting the files loaded by the web page using the browser’s developer tools, we locate the hidden encoded string inside the about.html file.

The string is identified as **Base64-encoded** data.
