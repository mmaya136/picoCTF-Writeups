## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to discover the hidden flag by analyzing how
the web application processes authentication and redirects the user between
pages.

- --

## Description
The challenge presents a login form where the instructions indicate that the
correct credentials are:

- Username: `test`
- Password: `test!`

After logging in, the application redirects the user to another page. The goal
is to analyze this behavior to uncover hidden information that leads to the
flag.

## Methodology

### 1. Accessing the Login Page

<img width="886" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d2e637d-b92b-46f8-9f20-dd7f492c042f" />

First, the challenge instance is launched and the login form is accessed.
The provided credentials are entered:

Username: test
Password: test!

After submitting the form, the page redirects to another location that does not
immediately display the flag.

### 2. Intercepting Traffic with Burp Suite
To analyze the communication between the client and the server, **Burp Suite**
is used to intercept and inspect HTTP requests and responses.

By capturing the login request, it is possible to observe how the application
processes authentication and how it handles redirections after successful login.

### 3. Analyzing the First Redirect
Analyzing the request ,we observe that there's a redirect** similar to:
<img width="1022" height="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdfb0a67-edb5-44dd-843c-c887848a9493" />
```javascript
"GET /next-page/id=<encoded_value> HTTP 1.1"
```
The encoded value is extracted from the intercepted response and analyzed.
It appears to be encoded using Base64.

### 4. Decoding Base64 Data
The encoded value is decoded using the following command:
<img width="756" height="141" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b4c52aa-d9a1-47d1-b2c3-17d6db293ea8" />

echo "cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs" | base64 -d
This reveals part of the flag:

picoCTF{proxies_al
### 5. Following Additional Redirects
By continuing to intercept traffic with Burp Suite, another redirect is detected containing a second Base64 string.
<img width="1025" height="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/292c8286-559e-43c4-9180-7812e4648900" />

<img width="797" height="152" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fbeca59-a134-48fb-a7e4-146b9096d144" />

The second encoded value is decoded:

echo "bF90aGVfd2F5X3NkOWUzNjk3fQ==" | base64 -d
This reveals the remaining portion of the flag:

l_the_way_3d9e3697}
### 6. Reconstructing the Flag
Both decoded strings are combined to obtain the full flag.


Result
By intercepting HTTP traffic, analyzing redirections, and decoding hidden Base64 values, the full flag is successfully recovered.

## Flag
picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_3d9e3697}
