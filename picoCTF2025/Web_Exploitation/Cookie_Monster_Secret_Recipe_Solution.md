## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to uncover the hidden cookie recipe by analyzing and manipulating web cookies used by the website.

## Description
Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website.  
The challenge hints that the secret is not directly visible on the page, meaning it is likely stored or controlled through client-side data.

By inspecting how the website uses cookies, it is possible to modify them and gain access to the hidden content.

## Methodology
First, the challenge instance is launched and the website is accessed.  
The page presents a simple login form requesting a username and password.

After attempting to log in with arbitrary credentials, the application responds with an **“Access Denied”** message.  
The page includes a hint suggesting that authentication is handled through **cookies** rather than credentials.

Next, the browser’s **Developer Tools** are opened and the **Network** tab is inspected to analyze the interactions between the client and the server.  
By examining the HTTP requests and responses, a cookie named `secret_recipe` is identified in the server response headers, containing a long Base64-encoded value.

The value of this cookie is copied and analyzed.
