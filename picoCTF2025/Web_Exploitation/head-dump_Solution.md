## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to locate and access an exposed endpoint that leaks a memory dump containing the hidden flag.

## Description
The challenge presents a simple blog-style web application with multiple articles, including one related to API documentation.  
The description hints that the server exposes an endpoint capable of generating files that contain the server’s memory, where the flag is hidden.

The task is to explore the application, identify the vulnerable endpoint, and extract the flag from the exposed data.

## Methodology
First, the challenge instance is launched and the web application is explored through the browser.

The site contains several blog posts, including one related to **API documentation**, suggesting the presence of additional backend endpoints.

Next, the API documentation interface is inspected, where a **GET endpoint named `/heapdump`** is discovered.  
The endpoint description indicates that it is used for diagnosing the server’s memory allocation.

Using the provided interface (or directly through the browser), a request is sent to the endpoint:
